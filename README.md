##Description
The purpose of this application is to turn Steam's Big Picture mode into a
retro console gaming paradise. This application accomplishes this in two ways,
the first is by coming bundled with a set of emulators pre-set up with an Xbox
controller in mind (Xbox only because of how well supported it is in Windows).
The second is to 'watch' a predetermined set of directories, and when a ROM is
added to any of those directories, having it added to Steam.

While this is not the only experience I hope to enable via this application,
the driving goal behind this application is to allow someone to download all
of the ROMs for a certain system, throw them in a folder, and then be able to
use Steam's Big Picture mode to act as a ROM chooser, so they can go and play
their favorite game on X console extremely easily, similar to how buddwm does
it in his NES/SNES PC build projects. You can find the videos I am talking
about here:
