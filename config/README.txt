This folder contains configuration files to help easily set up a seamless emulator experience. Below is a description of the functionality provided by each file and how to use it.

As a note for the registry files, I include them as separate files because registry files can be used to infect computers, so I would like to give you the opportunity to check the file yourself before you run it.

=================Files=================

---ExitCombo.cfg
This is a JoyToKey configuration file which makes it so that holding select and then hitting start will close the currently running emulator. To set it up, download and install JoyToKey from the following website:

http://www.electracode.com/4/joy2key/JoyToKey%20English%20Version.htm

After putting JoyToKey in your Program Files folder, put the ExitCombo.cfg file inside the JoyToKey folder. This should make it show up as a current configuration in JoyToKey. Minimize JoyToKey, and then holding down select and pressing start should be the same as pressing ALT+F4 (aka will close the current window).

---Project64 Configuration\Fullscreen on loading ROM.reg
A registry file which sets the Project64 option to go into fullscreen immediately on loading. Double click to run it.

---Project64 Configuration\Xbox Controller Key Setup.reg
A registry file which sets an Xbox 360 controller key mapping as the default for Project 64. Double click to run it.
