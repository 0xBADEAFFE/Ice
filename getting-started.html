    <h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open <em>consoles.txt</em> in Notepad and make an entry for every
        console you want to support, leaving 'emulator' blank for now. For full
        details on how to set up an entry in <em>consoles.txt</em>, check out
        the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/faq/">FAQ</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Install an emulator for each console you listed. If you aren't
        familiar with any emulators that support a console, check the
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/emulators/">Emulators</a> page, or Wikipedia's fantastic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_emulators">List of Video Game Emulators</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Make an entry in <em>emulators.txt</em> for each emulator you installed.
        For full details on how to set up an emulator in <em>emulators.txt</em>,
        check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/faq/">FAQ</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go back to <em>consoles.txt</em>, and for each console, list the
        name of the emulator you want to use under 'emulator'.
      </li>
    </ol>
    For example, if I wanted to set up Dolphin with the Nintendo Gamecube and
    Nintendo Wii, and ZSNES with the Super Nintendo, I might have a setup like this...
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>emulators.txt</b>
<pre>[Dolphin]
location=C:\Emulators\Dolphin\dolphin.exe
command=%l --batch --exec=%r

[ZSNES]
location=C:\Emulators\ZSNES\zsnesw.exe
command=%l %r</pre>
    <br />
    <b>consoles.txt</b>
<pre>[Super Nintendo]
nickname=SNES
emulator=ZSNES

[Nintendo Gamecube]
nickname=Gamecube
emulator=Dolphin

[Nintendo Wii]
nickname=Wii
emulator=Dolphin</pre>

    <h3>Adding ROMs</h3>
      Once you have all of your consoles/emulators set up, you are ready to start
      adding ROMs to Steam. To do so, follow these steps.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Run Ice. This will create a 'ROM's directory, where you place any ROMs
          you want added to Steam.<br /><br />
          <div class="alert alert-info">
            By default, your ROMs directory is in <b>C:\Users\*username*\ROMs</b> on Windows,
            <b>/Users/*username*/ROMs</b> on Mac, or <b>/home/*username*/ROMs</b> on Linux.
            If you would prefer it somewhere else, you can change this location in
            <em>config.txt</em>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Open your ROMs folder. It should contain a single folder for each console,
          named with the consoles 'nickname'. In the example above, the ROMs
          directory would look like this.
<pre>|--ROMs
   |--Gamecube
   |--SNES
   |--Wii</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Put your ROMs in the folder representing the console. If I wanted to
          add 'Mega Man X' (for Super Nintendo), the ROM would go in <em>ROMs\SNES</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Run Ice again. You should see messages confirming that Ice detected
          the emulators/consoles, and messages confirming that Ice added your
          ROMs to Steam
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Adding Custom Images</h3>
    By default, Ice attempts to download artwork for every game that you add.
    This isn't perfect though, and if you aren't happy with the artwork that Ice
    finds, you can replace it with your own by following these steps.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go online, and find an image for your game. This image needs to be 460x215.
        If you are unsure of where to look, I recommend checking out
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://steambanners.booru.org">http://steambanners.booru.org</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/steamgrid">/r/SteamGrid</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Open Steam, and switch to the 'grid' view. You can switch views by clicking
        the buttons next to 'Big Picture'. Grid is the one on the far right.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click on the game whose image you want to change, and hit 'Remove
        Custom Image'. If the game had no image to begin with, you can skip this
        step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click on the game again, and hit 'Set Custom Image'. A dialog box
        will pop up, and you can choose the image you would like to use. Select
        the image you acquired in Step 1, and hit 'OK'.
      </li>
      <li>
        Congratulations, you are done! Enjoy your nice new image
      </li>
    </ol>
