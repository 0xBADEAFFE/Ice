This class represents the Console datatype. Each ROM is associated with a
Console, and each Console has many ROMs. A Console also is associated with an
emulator, which can be used to play a ROM.

Functionality should be added to this class/module if it deals with Consoles or
their emulators. This includes finding a list of ROMs in this console's folder.
