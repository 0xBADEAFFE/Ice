Abstracts away filesystem specific information into app-specific methods. For
example, the app doesn't care about where exactly on the filesystem the ROMs
directory is located, it just wants to know what ROMs are a part of it. This
module is meant to deal with that abstraction.

Functionality should be added to this module if it involves the filesystem, but
doesn't heavily involve any of the other datatypes used by this app (Consoles,
ROMs, etc)
