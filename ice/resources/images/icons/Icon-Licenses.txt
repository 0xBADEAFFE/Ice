NOTES REGARDING ICONS: Each icon has a different license, which I mention 
below. If you are looking to use my code in a way which violates the terms of
the license for any of the icons, it is up to you to find replacements.

The NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, PS1, PS2, Genesis, Dreamcast, and GBA icons
were all made by Deleket (http://www.deleket.com), whose work I found here:

They are listed as free for non-commercial use. Thanks Deleket!

The Nintendo DS icon comes from draseart, whose work I found here: 
http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/draseart.html
The icon is free for non-commercial use. Thanks draseart!

The Gameboy icon comes from 177 icons, whose work I found here:
http://www.gettyicons.com/free-icon/143/old-school-icon-set/free-gameboy-icon-png/
The icon is listed as free for commercial use, but selling and claiming
ownership is not allowed. Thanks to 177 icons!
