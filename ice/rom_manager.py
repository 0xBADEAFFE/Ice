The purpose of this class is to handle the interaction (or some would say 
conversion) between ROMs and Steam Shortcuts. This class also handles checking
to make sure I don't add duplicates of any ROMs to Steam.

Functionality should be added to this class if it involves the interaction
between ROMs and Steam Shortcuts.
